/*
The Board component will be responsible for much of
the game's functioning. It will contain a grid of squares,
whose size is determined by the stage, and which may of may
not contain a piece. The name of the piece occupying the squares,
and whether it is a player or enemy piece, are stored in a useState Hook.

The Board is also responsible for starting the game, starting each stage,
detecting game overs, and allowing for piece movement.
